# Clean Architecture Rebuild (Branch)

This branch contains an ongoing refactor of the Warehouse Management System using Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture principles.

The goal of this branch is to establish a new project structure with clear separation of concerns across Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers.

Work in progress.
